# DogCatcher

Dog Catcher game written in Java for iOS/Android. 

A net captures attempts to capture dogs that are moving around in the world containing cats. 
The goal of the game is to catch the dogs with a 'high' score. 

A dog becomes slower and changes color if it gets scratched by a cat. For each scratch, a dog will be worth one less point.
An unscratched dog is worth 10 points and can take upto 5 scratches until becoming unable to move. 

If two cats collide together, then a kitten will be produced and added to the world. 
If a cat is captured in the net, 10 points will be deducted.
